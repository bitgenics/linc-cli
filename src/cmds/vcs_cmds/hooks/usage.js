const explanation = `By setting up a VCS webhook, you can automate part of your LINC
experience. In stead of manually building and publishing your 
site, we can actually start the build as soon as you've pushed 
new code to your repository.

All we need (after your authorised LINC to access your repository) 
is the URL of the repository you want to set up for automatic 
deploying.
